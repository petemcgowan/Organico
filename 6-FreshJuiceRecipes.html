                    <div class="post-content"><p>As those of you who read The West Cork People will know I am back on track with daily juicing at the moment and loving it. I don't really follow recipes as such, which sometimes backfires - I'm not sure this mornings concoction of cabbage, celery, kale, apple, pear, green beans, mange tout, green grapes and lime was all that popular with my long-suffering husband for example! Most mornings I use carrots, beetroot, apple and orange, or fennel, celery, apple, kale and parsley. I always try to make my juices primarily from vegetables (always organic of course - you don;t want concentrated chemicals in your juice if you can avoid it!!). A little fruit is nice but mainly I eat my fruit whole, as I'm trying not to get too much fructose (fruit sugar) and juiced fruit would contain a lot of fructose.</p>

                            <p>Here are a few recipes I have found enjoyable. Bear in mind that you can vary quantities depending on how many people you are juicing for. Each recipes makes about 1 large serving. Most vegetables and fruits I just wash, chop and juice. Obviously you peel all citrus fruits.</p>

                            <p>A favourite in Organico Cafe is this one:</p>
                            <p>Blend rather than juice:<br>
                            1 small melon<br>
                            1 punnet of strawberries<br>
                            Handful of mint leaves</p>
                            <p>Enjoy!!</p></div>
