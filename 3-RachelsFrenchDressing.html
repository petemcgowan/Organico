                        <strong>Ingredients:
                        </strong>2 tablespoons of organic cider vinegar (or a mixture of vinegar and lemon juice)
                        4-6 tablespoons of organic cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil or organic rapeseed oil
                        1 teaspoon of honey (or maple syrup)
                        1 teaspoon of mustard (Dijon/whole grain)
                        1 clove of garlic, crushed
                        salt and pepper
                        
                        Get a clean screw top jam jar and add the vinegar, honey, mustard, salt, pepper, garlic and herbs (if using). Mix well until the honey and mustard have&nbsp;dissolved. Now, add the oil, start with 4 tbs. Put the lid on the jar and give in a good shake. Taste and adjust the seasoning - if it’s too sharp, add more oil, if it’s too sweet add more mustard and salt, and so on. Taste the dressing on a piece of lettuce rather than straight of the spoon, as it always tastes stronger on its own. If you keep the dressing in the fridge, olive oil will solidify, don’t worry just take it out and give it a good shake. Fresh herbs are great if you are using it all straight away but not advisable if you’re making a week's worth, as they turn black in the acid of the vinegar. I prefer to add lots of fresh herbs to the salad itself.
