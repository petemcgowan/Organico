<p dir="ltr">Soup is one of the simplest, most satisfying and economical meals to make. If you can make a good soup you can always feed your family and friends whatever you have in the cupboard. </p><p>
Unlike salads which need to be made from the brightest, most vibrant vegetables, soup can be made using up all the veg you have left at the end of the week, which means they will always be slightly different - but if you get the base right they will always be tasty.</p><p>
A good bowl of soup is like a hug from an old friend, something that brightens up even the dullest of days!</p>
<p dir="ltr">This recipe will easily serve 2-4 people depending on hunger levels.<!--more--><br><strong>Ingredients:</strong>

                        <li>1 leek, split down the middle and sliced</li>
                        <li>1 fennel bulb, diced</li>
                        <li>1 400g can of haricot beans</li>
                        <li>1 litre of vegetable stock or 1tbsp Marigold stock powder in boiling water</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons of Sea Spice seaweed flakes</li>
                        <li>bunch parsley, chopped</li>
                    </ul>

                                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy based saucepan. Add the onion, carrot and celery and saute for 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add the garlic, rosemary, and sweet potato and cook for another few minutes before adding the rest of the vegetables and a few twists of fresh black pepper.</li>
                        <li>Saute for another 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the stock and simmer until the sweet potato and carrot are soft, usually another 5 to 10 minutes. Add the drained and rinsed beans, along with the seaweed flakes and check the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
                        <li>Heat the beans through, sometimes you need a little extra water at this stage if its reduced too much, stir in half the parsley and serve with the rest on top. Enjoy!</li>
