Dermatologically tested, Magnesium Body Lotion has passed the most rigorous of trials so that you can be confident of its suitability for, and effective support, of the most sensitive skin conditions and the harshest of modern environments.

Specifications
Product size: 180ml
Active Ingredients: Magnesium Chloride and Shea Butter

Importance of magnesium
A powerful mineral, magnesium is responsible for 325 chemical reactions inside the body and helps support calcium absorption, maintenance of normal bones and teeth, normal psychological function, and healthy functioning of the nervous system.

Magnesium also helps improve rest and recovery by contributing to a reduction in tiredness and fatigue, electrolyte balance and supports normal energy-yielding metabolism.

How to use
Apply 5ml (4 pumps) around the body and massage well into the skin to stimulate absorption.

After a shower or bath is a great time to apply as the skin is warm and the pores are open which aids absorption. Apply anywhere on the body avoiding delicate areas. Concentrate on joints, muscles and areas of concern. Reapply whenever needed.

Dosage
5ml (4 pumps) of magnesium body lotion delivers a minimum of 120mg of magnesium.

Storage
Once opened, store at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. Use within 12 months of opening. Keep out of reach and sight of children.

Warnings
For external use only; Avoid contact with eyes; Do not use on damaged or broken skin. Supplements should not replace a balanced diet or healthy lifestyle.

The Magnesium Tingle
On initial application you may experience a slight tingling sensation. This may indicate low magnesium levels and is the result of the high speed absorption of magnesium through the pores. This will pass with regular use and as absorption commences immediately, skin can be towelled off after massaging in.

Suitable For:

All ages
Use on sensitive skin
Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding
Vegans
Vegetarians
No contraindications with prescribed medications.

Long Description: 
Palm Free Irish Soap Shampoo, Body & Shaving Bar Thyme Travel (1pce)

Travel light with our Thyme Travel Shampoo Bar. Scented with an invigorating blend of Lavender, Geranium and claryfying Thyme to revitalise the hair and awaken the senses. A unique shampoo bar that is mild enough for everyday use, yet long lasting and hard enough to cope with the rigors of travel.

We use an extremely high percentage of Fair-trade, Organic Shea butter, with the addition of Panthenol and Zinc Oxide which together, helps lock in moisture, strengthen hair and soothe sensitive scalps. The addition of Organic Apple Cider Vinegar helps create an even milder bar and balance the skin’s pH. No expense has been spared in creating these long lasting moisturising bars, which are the most competitively priced on the market today.

Features:

Ideal for travel as it takes up very little space
Panthenol and Zinc Oxide hydrate and heal, while strengthening hair strands.
Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (with the mother) balances pH of hair, reduces frizz and adds shine.
Anti-inflammatory Organic Marshmallow root & Comfrey soothes sensitive skin and speeds healing.
Free From SLS, Parabens and Synthetic Fragrances
Made with 100% pure Coconut Oil, Organic Shea Butter and Fresh Filtered Rainwater
Application: Apply sparingly to wet hair to create a creamy lather and massage into scalp. Rinse thoroughly with warm water. Repeat if desired.

Important Note: Some hair types can go through what is known as a Transition Period. Hair may feel oily and ‘unclean’ for the first few washes. This is the hair adjusting from exposure to potentially chemical laden products and after a handful of washes, your scalp and hair will begin to produce its own healthy, protective oils.

An Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) rinse is particularly beneficial for this problem as it helps restore the natural pH of the scalp and leaves hair feeling softer and shinier. Create your own by mixing 1-2 tbsp of ACV to 250ml of water, apply to scalp & hair and massage in for a few minutes before rinsing off.

Alternative Use: Due to its mild creamy texture, this makes an excellent shaving soap. It may also be used as a normal soap for those with sensitive skin.

Ingredients: Sodium Cocoate (Coconut Oil), Sodium Shea Butterate (Shea Butter), Sodium Oliveate (Olive Oil), Fresh Filtered Rainwater, Sodium Castorate, Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Panthenol (Vit B5), Parsnip Extract (Pastinaca sativa), Zinc Oxide, Marshmallow Root (Althaea officinalis), Comfrey (Symphytum officinale), Biotin. Essential Oils of: Lavendin (Lavendula hybrida), Thyme (Thymus serpyllum) & Geranium (Pelargonium graveolens)Naturally Occurring Constituents of Essential Oils: Geraniol, Citronellol, Citral, Limonene, Linalool.

Weleda Men's Body Wash 200ml
Everyone likes to smell good – but not everyone wants to use chemical gunk to make it happen. Weleda Men Active Shower Gel leaves you with a fresh, masculine smell, clean skin and a clear conscience.

This is what we mean by a fresh start. First thing in the morning, after sports or before an evening out, get invigorated and refreshed with all-natural MEN Active Shower Gel. The unique masculine fragrance comes from stimulating rosemary oil, lemony may chang, and men’s favourite vetiver – a mildly antiseptic grass with a warm, woody undertone. Does it do the job? Yes it does – using only natural cleansers, which foam up, rinse off and take grit, sweat and odours with them. Non-drying to the skin, non- harmful to the earth and definitely good for everyone who gets close to you. What’s not to like?


Directions for Use
Use daily under a running shower.
